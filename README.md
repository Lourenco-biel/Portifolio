## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

The 3D Portfolio is my personal website, designed to be visually engaging and interactive. It features animated 3D scenes, smooth camera transitions, and responsive layouts — all crafted to reflect my skills and creativity as a developer. This project allowed me to explore advanced front-end techniques while building something that truly represents who I am professionally.
